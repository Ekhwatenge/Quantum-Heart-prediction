# Quantum-Heart-prediction

This dataset is designed for heart disease prediction and integrates both traditional medical indicators and an additional QuantumPatternFeature. The dataset includes key clinical attributes such as Age, Gender, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, and Heart Rate, which are commonly used in cardiovascular risk assessment. The QuantumPatternFeature introduces an additional layer of complexity by capturing intricate, non-linear relationships. This feature enhances the datasetâ€™s potential for advanced predictive modeling, allowing researchers to explore new approaches in both classical and quantum machine learning.  With 500 samples, this dataset provides a well-structured foundation for testing various machine learning techniques, feature importance analysis, and model interpretability in medical diagnosis.

# Quantum Heart Prediction

## Overview

**Quantum Heart Prediction** is an R-based project aimed at analyzing heart disease prediction datasets. This project leverages statistical methods, machine learning models, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and predictors of heart disease. It also introduces the novel *Quantum Pattern Feature* as part of the dataset analysis.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles categorical variables, outliers, and scales numerical features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Provides histograms, bar plots, scatter plots, and correlation matrices for data visualization.
- **Model Building**: Implements logistic regression for heart disease prediction.
- **Scientific Discussion**: Includes interpretations and implications for academia, industry, and policy-making.

## Technologies Used

- **R Programming Language**
- **R Libraries**: `tidyverse`, `caret`, `corrplot`
- **R Markdown**: For generating reproducible reports

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- R (latest version)
- RStudio
- Required R packages (`tidyverse`, `caret`, `corrplot`)

### Setup
1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/EKhwatenge/Quantum-Heart-prediction.git
2. Open the project in RStudio.
3. Install required packages:
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "caret", "corrplot"))

## Usage
### Running the Analysis
1. Open the `QuantumHeartPrediction.Rmd` file in RStudio.
2. Knit the file to generate an HTML report.
3. Review the visualizations and model results in the generated report.

### Example Code Snippets
#### Data Preprocessing:
data$Gender <- as.factor(data$Gender)
data$HeartDisease <- as.factor(data$HeartDisease)
numerical_features <- c("Age", "BloodPressure", "Cholesterol", "HeartRate", "QuantumPatternFeature")
data[numerical_features] <- scale(data[numerical_features])

#### EDA
hist(data$Age, main="Age Distribution", xlab="Age", col="skyblue", border="white")
plot(data$Gender, main="Gender Distribution", ylab="Frequency", col=c("pink", "lightblue"))

#### Model Building
model <- glm(HeartDisease ~ ., data = train_data, family = "binomial")
summary(model)

## Visualizations

- **Histograms**: Age, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Heart Rate distributions.
- **Bar Plots**: Gender and Heart Disease prevalence.
- **Scatter Plots**: Relationships between predictors and heart disease.
- **Correlation Matrix**: Heatmap of feature correlations.

## Discussion

### Findings
1. Age and cholesterol levels are significant predictors of heart disease.
2. The *Quantum Pattern Feature* shows potential for identifying subgroups within the population.
3. Gender-based differences in heart disease prevalence were observed.

### Implications
#### Academia
Encourages further research into novel predictors like the Quantum Pattern Feature.

#### Industry
Supports development of diagnostic tools using advanced data-driven approaches.

#### Policy Makers
Provides insights for targeted interventions in high-risk populations.
